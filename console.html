    <p>The PlayStation 5 is powered by a custom system on a chip (SoC) designed in tandem by AMD and Sony,[33] integrating a custom 7 nm AMD Zen 2 CPU with eight cores running at a variable frequency capped at 3.5 GHz.[34] The integrated GPU is also a custom unit based on AMD's RDNA 2 graphics architecture.[35] The GPU has 36 compute units running at a variable frequency capped at 2.23 GHz, making it capable of a peak theoretical performance of 10 teraFLOPS.[15][36] The GPU supports hardware-accelerated real-time ray tracing, a rendering technique that allows for realistic lighting and reflections.[11] The console has 16 GB of GDDR6 SDRAM with a peak bandwidth of 448 GB/s,[34] and integrates Bluetooth 5.1, and 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6).[37]</p>
